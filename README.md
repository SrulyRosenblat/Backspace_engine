untitled ghost game

In this game (no real game goal, just float around) you are able to controll a ghost and move around a house aditionaly you have a baby ghost that for the most part follows you around , while the house itself is just one room and non interactive I worked hard to make both the players ghost and the baby ghost feel like they are breathing and simulating inteligence by having the baby ghost move around on its own.

controlls:
- up key
- down key
- left key
- right key

mechanics:
- the players ghost has a hovering animation that is always playing when its not moving, but turned off while in vertical motion so as not to interfare with the players movement.
- bounded play area so both the player and non player ghost cannot leave the screen.
- the baby ghost follows the player around for the most part and will useally stop just short of touching the player.
- I simulated boredom with the baby ghost so that if the player stays stagnent for to long it will go off on its own to explore.
- both the player and non player ghost could turn around and switch directions when they do so.
- I made holding a key work as oppose to needing to press again for every movement.
- wait in one place for a while to activate the baby ghosts boredom and it will roam around for a bit and go to a random part of the room.


alterations to the game engine:
- I made a small change to the unit class so that two images are stored for left and right directions.


image sources:
    I lost the actual image sources when I switched phones (stored on whatsapp) but both the background and player ghost were taken directly from the internet (except for things like fliping and removing background), the baby ghost was modified visualy and I changed things like color so may be harder to find it.
